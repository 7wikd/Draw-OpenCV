# Draw-OpenCV

- A fun, basic project written in Python. 
- Tries to follow pen and create lines

### Features
- Uses OpenCV
- Identifies colors of a pen, and draws accordingly in the color
- For now, only set to identify 3 colors(Fluorescent Pink, Dark Green and Fluorescent Yellow)

### Limitations
- Requires white background(for now)
- Heavily relies on lighting
- Speed control necessary
- Manually insert color-HSV codes using the values from ```colors_HSV.py```
